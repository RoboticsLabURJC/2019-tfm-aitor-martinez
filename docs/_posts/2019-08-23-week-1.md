This week, using [tello sdk](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/2d4dce68897a46b19fc717f3576b7c6a/Tello%20%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3/For%20Tello/Tello%20SDK%20Documentation%20EN_1.3_1122.pdf), I have developed a python class to communicate with drone.

I've also developed a [teleoperator for the drone](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-aitor-martinez/tello_teleop).

Use instructions are in the directory.
To move the drone, use following commands (You need to hold down the keys):

| Key   | Command      |
|-------|--------------|
| up    | move front   |
| down  | move back    |
| left  | move left    |
| right | move right   |
| w     | move up      |
| s     | move down    |
| a     | rotate left  |
| d     | rotate right |
